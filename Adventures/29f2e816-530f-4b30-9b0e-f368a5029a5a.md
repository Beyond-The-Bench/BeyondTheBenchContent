This year, my mum and I headed to the **Adventure Bike Rider Festival** at Ragley Hall, bringing along our **BMW F750GS** and **KTM 450 EXC**. It turned out to be a cracking weekend on two wheels.

### Setting Up and Hitting the Trails

We found a decent spot for the van and wrestled with the tall roof tent before settling in. Once set up, I took the BMW out for a ride around the 50km adventure trail — a great mix of off-road sections and flowing gravel. Mum explored the festival while I was out, and we met up later for food and an early night.

### Talks, Bikes, and Big Names

Saturday was packed. We spent the day checking out the exhibitors, watching a film on the **Arizona Backcountry Discovery Route**, and listening to talks from riders like **Lyndon Poskitt**. The GoPro Arena was a highlight — riders pushing big adventure bikes to the limit in front of a big crowd.

### A Final Ride and a Bit of Drama

On Sunday, we both got one more lap of the trail in before packing up. Just as we started the journey home, the trailer tyre came off. Luckily, we’d pulled into a layby. We unloaded the KTM, moved the trailer off the road and with the help of my Dad got it into the van which he then drove home as we rode the bikes back.

### Final Thoughts

The festival was a great mix of riding, talks, and meeting other bikers. We’ll definitely be back in **2026** — and next time, we’ll arrive earlier on Friday to make the most of it before things wind down on Sunday.
