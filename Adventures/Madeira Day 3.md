We had a slower start today, sleeping in until about 9 and easing into the morning before heading out for a day in Funchal.

Our first stop was **Cabo Girão**, a cliffside viewpoint with a glass floor. The view was incredible—coastlines stretching for miles and a dizzying drop beneath our feet. Tiana was _not_ a fan of the glass, visibly shaking while trying to take in the view (and posing bravely for the camera). We weren’t alone—there were tuk tuks everywhere and a sizeable crowd of tourists, so after soaking it up for about 15 minutes, we hopped back on the moped.

Next, we zipped back into **Funchal** and parked up on the street, ready to explore the old town. The buildings were charming and full of character. We wandered past a church that had a memorial to _Pope Francis (RIP)_—not entirely sure what that was about, but it did make us pause.

For lunch, we returned to an old favourite—**Bolo do Caco**, stuffed with chorizo and garlic butter for Tiana, and bacon, cheese, and garlic butter for Ollie. Truly elite combinations.

Then it was time for the **cable car ride** up to Monte. We shared the gondola with some other tourists, but the views over the city made up for it. At the top, we headed into **Monte Palace Gardens**, which were unexpectedly cool: a surreal mash-up of tropical plants, azulejo tile panels, koi ponds, Chinese sculptures, waterfalls, and even a few rogue flamingos and peacocks. Also: more cats, which is becoming a daily tradition.

After wandering the gardens, we took the cable car back down and strolled through Funchal some more. We passed the beach, watched pirate-style boats docking in the harbour, and Tiana picked up some **cork souvenirs**.

For dinner, we treated ourselves to **tacos from a Mexican place**—absolutely hit the spot. On the way back, Tiana got a **Portuguese custard tart** from a bakery, which she saved until we got home and described as _delectable_.

Back at the cabin, we chilled out with some **Desperate Housewives** before winding down for the night.

**Tiana rating:** 9/10 – Solid day.  
**Ollie rating:** 9/10 – Fewer people would’ve bumped it up.
