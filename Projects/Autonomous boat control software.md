This project started as a way to control a sailboat by clicking on a map â€” and now, after a bit of hacking, simulating, and path-finding wizardry, it does exactly that.

Basically, Iâ€™ve built a system that lets you click a point on a map of a lake, and the boat figures out how to get there and sails off on its own. Itâ€™s all running in simulation for now, but the plan is to eventually use it on real hardware.

### The low-level stuff: ArduPilot firmware

On the boat side, everythingâ€™s built around a flight controller running [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/)'s rover firmware â€” specifically its **sailboat mode**, which has a load of really useful features already baked in. Things like waypoint missions, tacking to reach upwind targets, and general autonomous control are all just there.

Since I donâ€™t have a physical boat yet, Iâ€™ve been using the ArduPilot Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform to simulate everything. This lets me test the full system as if I had real hardware â€” super useful.

To get it running, I used:

`sim_vehicle.py -v Rover -f sailboat -l "51.6681611,-1.9201958,0,0" --speed 5`

This starts up a simulated sailboat on a custom lake location, running faster than real time so Iâ€™m not sat there watching it crawl across the screen.

### Talking to the boat: MavLink

All the communication with the boat happens over [MAVlink](https://mavlink.io/en/), which is a protocol used by loads of drones and other autonomous vehicles. In this case, Iâ€™m using it to send commands from a Python control script to the flight controller.

In a real-world setup, that script would probably be running on a Raspberry Pi, sending commands over a telemetry radio. For now, it's just running locally and talking to the SITL instance.

While I was setting this all up, I also used QGroundControl to double-check that the simulator and MavLink connections were working properly â€” itâ€™s handy for visualising missions and status info.

### The brains: Python server with pathfinding

On the other end of the MavLink connection is a Python server using `pymavlink` to talk to the boat. This server also exposes an API that connects to the frontend.

The key features:

- It provides live boat position data to the frontend.

- It receives new destination coordinates when a user clicks on the map.

- It checks the destination is within a defined geo-fence.

- It runs an **A*** pathfinding algorithm to work out a safe route across the lake (even dodging around islands or obstacles).

- It then uploads that route as a list of waypoints to the boat.

Once uploaded, you just switch the boat into **AUTO** mode, and off it goes, following the waypoints.

### The frontend: Vite + MapboxGL

To make all this usable, I put together a simple frontend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [MapboxGL](https://www.mapbox.com/). It overlays a custom image of the lake on the map, which makes it look cleaner and more usable than default satellite views.

The frontend connects to the Python server via WebSockets to:

- Show live position updates from the boat

- Send new destination clicks back to the server


Click a spot on the map â†’ route gets planned â†’ boat sails there. Easy.

### Whatâ€™s next?

It all works pretty well for now, but thereâ€™s still plenty of stuff I want to improve:

- Itâ€™d be nice to show the boatâ€™s current mode in the UI â€” sometimes it doesnâ€™t move because itâ€™s not armed or not in AUTO, and thatâ€™s not always obvious.

- Pathfinding could be made smarter and more efficient. ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250412222535.webp)

- A visual tool to define the geo-fence would make setup easier, especially when moving to different lakes or test areas.


But as a prototype? It does the job. Once weâ€™ve got real hardware, this should make it way easier to test and demo autonomous sailing logic in a clean, interactive way.
