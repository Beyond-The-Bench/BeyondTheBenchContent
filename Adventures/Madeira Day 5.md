We set off today for a proper adventure, aiming to reach the mystical **Fanal Forest**. The ride was a long one, winding up through the mountains, but halfway there we stopped at a **beautiful viewpoint** to stretch our legs and take in the sweeping scenery.

Eventually, we reached Fanal, where **cows roamed freely** and the road became a bit more of an off-road experience. We parked up and entered the forest, where the **fog was thick**, the **trees were gnarled and mysterious**, and the atmosphere was something straight out of a fantasy film.

We wandered down through the mist towards a **lake that had completely dried up** — probably because **Tiana slurped it all up through a straw** (allegedly). She then **forged her own path** straight up a steep hillside back toward the main forest. Ollie attempted to follow and promptly got **absolutely covered in mud**.

On the way back we found a **pond full of extremely loud frogs**, before hiking up a final foggy hill and stumbling upon another small pond nestled among the trees. After a few more photos, we made our way back to the moped and rode down to a **busy viewpoint with a cool swing**, but sadly didn’t get to try it — the queue was too long and we were on a mission.

Next stop was **Porto Moniz**, where the **stormy sea crashed against the rocks** right next to where we parked. We wandered around and eventually found a small café for lunch — **more bolo do caco**, of course. Tiana had a smoothie, Ollie had a Fanta, and we had a nice chat before heading off along the seafront.

The **natural swimming pools** were shut at first due to the rough sea, but as we walked, we spotted they had reopened. So, we ran back, grabbed tickets, stashed our stuff in a locker, and prepared for **some serious Type 2 fun**.

The pools were **SO COLD**. Tiana was **very brave**, and Ollie was **also brave, just also very cold**. Huge waves **crashed over the walls**, making it even colder, but we slowly eased ourselves in. Ollie took the plunge and started swimming lengths, while Tiana took her time adjusting to the icy water.

Eventually, the chill got to us both and we got out — only to find our **locker key wouldn’t work**. We had to get someone to help unlock it, but crisis was averted. After drying off and changing, we took a few more photos of the pools and hopped back on the moped for the journey home.

Back at the cabin, Tiana went into **antisocial mode**, so Ollie went off on a **solo trek**. He found a **cool bridge, a river, a waterfall, and a levada**, all down a very steep and sketchy trail. He was **incredibly brave** (even more so because he missed Tiana deeply the whole time).

Once reunited, we rode down to a **tiny roadside shed** perched on the mountain to get **Tiana some chicken wings** and chips for tea. They were **delicious**, but the portion was huge, so the leftovers were wrapped up for tomorrow.

Ollie cooked up some **chorizo pasta** to finish the last of the ingredients, and we settled in for another episode of **Desperate Housewives**. After dinner, we started **tidying up the cabin**, eating leftover kiwis and doing all the washing up in preparation for checkout tomorrow.

Ollie took a **well-earned shower**, and then we both got ready for bed, full of food and good vibes.

**Ollie rating** – 10/10: lunch could have been better, but the pools were peak Type 2 fun  
**Tiana rating** – 10/10: crisps could have been crispier, but otherwise perfection
