The morning of our last day arrived far too quickly. We spent the final moments of our holiday **finishing up packing** and tidying the cabin, trying to savour the last bits of the Madeira atmosphere. It was time to say goodbye to the island, and so we made our way out to **drop off the moped**.

On the way to drop the moped off, we stopped for fuel to fill the tank back up, which brought the total fuel bill to only 24 euros for the week. The moped hire team gave us a lift to the airport, and before we knew it, we were at the **departure gate**.

The flight back was uneventful… mostly. **Ollie gave up his seat** for a crying child during takeoff — the sacrifice of a good Samaritan, right? That left us with a slightly more peaceful flight than it might’ve been, but we finally touched down at **Bristol airport** after what felt like the longest journey home.

We grabbed our bags and picked up the car, where we quickly sat down and ate the **wraps** we made earlier with leftover chicken from yesterday. A simple meal, but it hit the spot.

The drive home was a little sleepy — **Tiana was very tired**, and it was starting to catch up with her. But we made it back to our **home safe and sound**, even if the drive was a little nerve-wracking at times. It was good to be home, but we both couldn't help but feel that pinch of sadness that the holiday had come to an end.

### **Holiday Summary**

What a trip. Looking back, **Madeira was everything we hoped for and more**. From the stunning **levada walks** and **waterfalls** to the freezing but exhilarating swim in the **natural pools**, we both had incredible experiences we’ll cherish forever. We ate amazing food, explored some beautiful landscapes, and even found time to relax and recharge.

**Tiana's favorite day** was definitely **Day 4**, when we explored the levada trail and discovered the stunning waterfalls. The whole day felt perfect, though she says the **swimming in the natural pool** on **Day 5** was her favourite activity of the entire trip. But like any good holiday, there had to be a worst day, and for Tiana, it was **Day 6**, when we had to say goodbye and fly home.

**Ollie’s best day** was **Day 5**. Between the adventure of the levada walk and the swimming in the natural pool, it had everything. His favourite activity, though, was the **levada walk**. The worst day for Ollie was similarly **Day 6**, when we had to leave. It was hard to match up to all the fun we had.

When it comes to **food**, **Tiana’s favourite restaurant** was the **Mexican place** where we had tacos and the traditional bolo de caco bread. Ollie, on the other hand, will always remember the **bolo de caco** he had in Funchal. The bread with chorizo and garlic butter was just unbeatable.

### **Final Thoughts**

Overall, **Madeira was a fantastic trip**. The island offers so much variety, from its stunning natural landscapes to its delicious food, and we both **highly recommend it**. If you’re looking for adventure, breathtaking views, and a good mix of relaxation and exploration, Madeira has it all.

We’re both already talking about going back someday, and it’s safe to say that this will be a trip we’ll talk about for years to come.
